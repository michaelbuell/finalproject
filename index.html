    <h1>Michael's Blog</h1>

    <h2>Ollie at the Zoo</h2>
    <p class="p1">We enjoy taking Ollie to the zoo and he enjoys it alot. We ended up getting an annual membership to the zoo because we take him all the time
        and it was more cost effective.

    <h2>Ollie and Rosie</h2>
    <p class="p1">We have 2 dogs: Rosie and Max. When Oliver was first born we were worried about how he would get along with the dogs, as his safety is our number 1
        concern. He is almost 2 years old and they have turned out to be his best friends. They will let him do basically anything to them and he tests this often. He
        climbs on top of them and rides them like a horse, he pulls on their ears and grabs their face and they just let him.

    <h2>Rosie Cut Me With Her Claws</h2>
    <p class="p1">I picked up Rosie's toy a few days ago to throw it in the back yard and she tried to grab the toy out of my hand with her paws while I was
        doing so, cutting my hand in the process.
