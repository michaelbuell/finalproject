# Final Project Retrospective
## What was done well?
- The goals for the project were met, creating a rough prototype of a blog including pictures and text posts. The code generates the intended web page successfully.
## What needs to be done better or differently?
- More styling and code could be used to give the website a better layout.
## What unexpected risks did we have to deal with?
- I was not really familiar with adding another live webpage to my GitHub profile so that took me some time to figure out.
## How does our project management process need to change to meet future goals?
- Next time I will start the project earlier, giving myself more time for error resolution and styling of the webpage.
