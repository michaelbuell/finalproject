    <h1>Michael Buell</h1>
    <h2>Major: Computing Applications, Computer Science</h2>

        <p>One of my main goals within this course is to gain more experience with the technology
            behind computer applications and grow my experiences. By building a firm foundation
            of how diffferent programs and systems work, I can improve my skills and stay up to 
            date with the evolving field of technology. This will not only help me perform better
            with course objectives, but also give me the confidence and skill to take on complex
            challenges throughout this educational journey and career.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Another important goal of mine is to open up more opportunities for myself in the Information
            Technology career field. Technology is a growing industry with endless opportunities and I want
            to prepare myself for for success within this field by developing the necessary skills that
            employers are looking for when growing their businesses. By learning more about computed applications
            and other systems, I can create a stronger foundation for a career that offers growth, stability,
            and the chance to make a real impact.
